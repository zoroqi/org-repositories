- [facebookresearch/VCMeshConv](https://github.com/facebookresearch/VCMeshConv) topic: pushed_at:2021-09 star:0.1k fork:0.0k Learning latent representations of registered meshes is useful for many 3D tasks. Techniques have recently shifted to neural mesh autoencoders.  Although they demonstrate higher precision than traditional methods, they remain unable to capture fine-grained deformations. Furthermore, these methods can only be applied to a template-specific surface mesh, and is not applicable to more general meshes, like tetrahedrons and non-manifold meshes. While more general graph convolution methods can be employed, they lack performance in reconstruction precision and require higher memory usage. In this paper, we propose a non-template-specific fully convolutional mesh autoencoder for arbitrary registered mesh data. It is enabled by our novel convolution and (un)pooling operators learned with globally shared weights and locally varying coefficients which can efficiently capture the spatially varying contents presented by irregular mesh connections. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on reconstruction accuracy. In addition, the latent codes of our network are fully localized thanks to the fully convolutional structure, and thus have much higher interpolation capability than many traditional 3D mesh generation models.

- [facebookresearch/FBTT-Embedding](https://github.com/facebookresearch/FBTT-Embedding) topic: pushed_at:2022-07 star:0.2k fork:0.0k This is a Tensor Train based compression library to compress sparse embedding tables used in large-scale machine learning models such as recommendation and natural language processing. We showed this library can reduce the total model size by up to 100x in Facebook’s open sourced DLRM model while achieving same model quality. Our implementation is faster than the state-of-the-art implementations. Existing the state-of-the-art library also decompresses the whole embedding tables on the fly therefore they do not provide memory reduction during runtime of the training. Our library decompresses only the requested rows therefore can provide 10,000 times memory footprint reduction per embedding table. The library also includes a software cache to store a portion of the entries in the table in decompressed format for faster lookup and process.

We find not only that this activity is heavily skewed, but that it also correlates with participation in groups and events. We validate the behavioral measure using a survey wherein people nominate social catalysts in their friend network. Whether a person will be nominated as a social catalyst can be predicted using network features and the tendency of their posts to prompt discussion. Although individuals' role as social catalysts has not attracted much study to date, this paper demonstrates that it can be studied both via behavioral and survey measures.

Here, touch provides high fidelity localized information while vision provides complementary global context. However, in 3D shape reconstruction, the complementary fusion of visual and haptic modalities remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we study this problem and present an effective chart-based approach to fusing vision and touch, which leverages advances in graph convolutional networks. To do so, we introduce a dataset of simulated touch and vision signals from the interaction between a robotic hand and a large array of 3D objects. Our results show that (1) leveraging both vision and touch signals consistently improves single-modality baselines, especially when the object is occluded by the hand touching it; (2) our approach outperforms alternative modality fusion methods and strongly benefits from the proposed chart-based structure; (3) reconstruction quality boosts with the number of grasps provided; and (4) the touch information not only enhances the reconstruction at the touch site but also extrapolates to its local neighborhood.

In this paper,  we show it is possible to produce much  higher  quality  lexicons  with  methods that  combine  (1)  unsupervised  bitext  mining and (2) unsupervised word alignment. Directly applying a pipeline that uses recent algorithms for  both  subproblems  significantly  improves induced lexicon quality and further gains are possible by learning to filter the resulting lex-ical entries, with both unsupervised and semi-supervised schemes.   Our final approach out-performs the state of the art on the BUCC 2020shared task by 14 F1 points averaged over 12 language pairs, while also providing a more interpretable  approach  that  allows  for  rich  reasoning of word meaning in context.

- [facebookresearch/Clockwork](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Clockwork) topic: pushed_at:2021-06 star:0.0k fork:0.0k Recurring batch data pipelines are a staple of the modern enterprisescale data warehouse. As a data warehouse scales to support more products and services, a growing number of interdependent pipelines running at various cadences can give rise to periodic resource bottlenecks for a cluster. This resource contention results in pipelines starting at unpredictable times each day and consequently variable landing times for the data artifacts they produce. The variability gets compounded by the dependency structure of the workload, and the resulting unpredictability can disrupt the project workstreams which consume this data. We present Clockwork, a delay-based global scheduling framework for data pipelines which improves landing time stability by spreading out tasks throughout the day. Whereas most scheduling algorithms optimize for makespan or average job completion times, Clockwork’s execution plan optimizes for stability in task completion times while also targeting predifined pipeline. Online experiments comparing this novel scheduling algorithm and a previously proposed greedy procrastinating heurstic show tasks complete almost an hour earlier on average, while exhibiting lower landing time variance and producing significantly less competition for resources in a target cluster.

In which, we present a causal speech enhancement model working on the raw waveform that runs in real-time on a laptop CPU. The proposed model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture with skip-connections. It is optimized on both time and frequency domains, using multiple loss functions. Empirical evidence shows that it is capable of removing various kinds of background noise including stationary and non-stationary noises, as well as room reverb. Additionally, we suggest a set of data augmentation techniques applied directly on the raw waveform which further improve model performance and its generalization abilities.

While leaderboards are a straightforward ranking of NLP models, this simplicity can mask nuances in evaluation items (examples) and subjects (NLP models). Rather than replace leaderboards, we advocate a re-imagining so that they better highlight if and where progress is made. Building on educational testing, we create a Bayesian leaderboard where latent subject skill and latent item difficulty predict correct responses. Using this model, we analyze the reliability of leaderboards. Afterwards, we show the model can guide what annotate, identify annotation errors, detect overfitting, and identify informative examples.

In contrast, neural network models for natural language modeling fail when such compositional generalization is required. The main contribution of this paper is to hypothesize that language compositionality is a form of group-equivariance. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a set of tools for constructing equivariant sequence-to-sequence models. Throughout a variety of experiments on the SCAN tasks, we analyze the behavior of existing models under the lens of equivariance, and demonstrate that our equivariant architecture is able to achieve the type compositional generalization required in human language understanding.

The new method employs gated neural networks that are trained to separate the voices at multiple processing steps, while maintaining the speaker in each output channel fixed. A different model is trained for every number of possible speakers, and the model with the largest number of speakers is employed to select the actual number of speakers in a given sample. Our method greatly outperforms the current state of the art, which, as we show, is not competitive for more than two speakers.
