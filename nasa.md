- [nasa/TCML](https://github.com/nasa/TCML) pushed_at:2018-08 star:0.0k fork:0.0k The Tip Clearance Modeling Library (TCML) was developed to model the dynamic variation of the high pressure turbine (HPT) tip clearance in aero-engine turbomachinery. The modeling techniques should be applicable to compressors as well. The model can be driven by prescribed inputs or seamlessly integrated with an aero-engine simulation such as one developed using the Toolbox for Modeling and Analysis of Thermodynamic Systems (T-MATS).

- [nasa/TSAT](https://github.com/nasa/TSAT) pushed_at:2018-08 star:0.0k fork:0.0k The Thermal Systems Analysis Toolbox (TSAT) is a MATLAB/Simulink based tool for modeling and analysis of dynamic thermal systems involving heat transfer. It is best suited for 1-D and 2-D heat transfer involving solid planar and cylindrical structures, however, the toolset is more extensive than this. The tools enable consideration of conduction, convection, and radiation boundary conditions. Some advanced capabilities are provided when it comes to approximating conduction within non-isotropic materials, structures with material transitions, and structures with time-varying temperature dependent material properties. Numerous tools are available to facilitate the construction of modular models of thermal systems and their integration with larger system models.
