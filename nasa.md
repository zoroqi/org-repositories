It is best suited for 1-D and 2-D heat transfer involving solid planar and cylindrical structures, however, the toolset is more extensive than this. The tools enable consideration of conduction, convection, and radiation boundary conditions. Some advanced capabilities are provided when it comes to approximating conduction within non-isotropic materials, structures with material transitions, and structures with time-varying temperature dependent material properties. Numerous tools are available to facilitate the construction of modular models of thermal systems and their integration with larger system models.

- [nasa/UQPCE](https://github.com/nasa/UQPCE) topic: pushed_at:2022-03 star:0.0k fork:0.0k Uncertainty Quantification using Polynomial Chaos Expansion (UQPCE) is an open source, python based research code for use in parametric, non-deterministic computational studies. UQPCE utilizes a non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion surrogate modeling technique to efficiently estimate uncertainties for computational analyses. The software allows the user to perform an automated uncertainty analysis for any given computational code without requiring modification to the source. UQPCE estimates sensitivities, confidence intervals, and other model statistics, which can be useful in the conceptual design and analysis of flight vehicles. This software was developed for the Aeronautics Systems Analysis Branch (ASAB) within the Systems Analysis and Concepts Directorate (SACD) at NASA Langley Research Center to study potential impacts of uncertainties on the prediction of ground noise generated from commercial supersonic aircraft concepts.
